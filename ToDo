Minimal viable product:
1)Stop service: Remove services that are specific for the service and not the ones that are also used by other services
2) Each service deployes in two or more instances. Excemption is services that handles specific hw (for obvious reasons)
2)
Nfvi -> Lost contact: 
nfv_mgr -> 	if possible move services to existing node
		if not possible - remove related application and all services

Contact with Nfvi:
nfv_mgr ->	scratch nfvi 
		Try to deploy depricated applications 

scratch nfvi:
	1.kill hidden nodes  rpc:call('Port@Host',init,stop,[]). 
	2.Remove service dirs
	 
Move vim functionality to nfv_mgr.


When a node restarts it scratch all services ..
If it comes back before tiem_out it will be wrong infromation regarding deploed services on that node
If it comesback after time out it is possibible that services are removed or not...

When a node disappers or have restarted - try to move services other working nodes ,if not possible remove from list.
